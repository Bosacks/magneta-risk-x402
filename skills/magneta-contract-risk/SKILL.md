description: Check a smart contract's risk before trading, approving, bridging or integrating it, using the Magneta Contract Risk x402 service (0-100 score, proxy/owner/mint/blacklist/fee flags, verified-source and static-analysis findings, 20 EVM chains, $0.01 USDC on Base per report, free bytecode-only preview). Use when the user or agent is about to sign a transaction involving an unfamiliar token or contract, asks whether a token looks like a rug or honeypot, wants a pre-signature safety check, or wants code that buys such a report over HTTP, MCP or a Coinbase Agentic Wallet. Not an audit.
compatibility: Node.js >= 20. Paid calls need a wallet holding USDC on Base mainnet (no ETH needed). Free tools need nothing.

# Magneta Contract Risk (x402)

Deterministic on-chain risk report for any deployed EVM contract. No LLM in the analysis: RPC reads, bytecode
opcode/selector scan, Blockscout/Sourcify verification and an `aderyn` static-analysis pass. Service: `https://x402.magneta.finance`.

## When to use

- Before swapping into, buying, approving (`approve`/`permit`) or sending funds to an unfamiliar token or protocol contract.
- Before bridging to or integrating a contract you did not deploy.
- As a pre-signature gate in an agent loop: score the counterparty, then decide.

Do not use it for externally-owned accounts (the API returns 422 `not_a_contract`), for non-EVM chains, or as a substitute for an audit.

## Endpoints

| Surface | Route / tool | Price |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP | `GET /v1/risk/:chainId/:address` | $0.01 USDC, Base mainnet (`eip155:8453`), x402 `exact` |
| HTTP | `GET /v1/flags/:chainId/:address` (bytecode-only preview) | free |
| MCP `https://x402.magneta.finance/mcp` | `contract_risk_summary {chainId:int, address:string}` | $0.01 |
| MCP | `contract_quick_flags`, `supported_chains`, `scoring_rubric` | free |

Chains (20): mainnets 1, 10, 56, 100, 130, 137, 146, 480, 5000, 8453, 42161, 42220, 43114, 59144, 81457, 534352;
testnets 84532, 11155111, 11155420, 421614. The payment is always in USDC on Base mainnet, whichever chain the target contract is on.

## Workflow

1. Free first: call `/v1/flags/:chainId/:address` (or `contract_quick_flags`). If it already shows a blocking flag for your use case, stop; no need to pay.
2. If the decision still depends on source verification, owner state or static analysis, buy the full report.
3. Read the report (below), apply your own threshold, and tell the user which flags drove the decision.
4. A report is cached server-side for 10 minutes per chain+address; the payment still happens on each call, so do not re-buy the same pair in a loop.

## Call it

Versions this repo is tested with: `@x402/core|evm|fetch|mcp` **2.28.0**, `viem` **2.57.7**, `@coinbase/cdp-sdk` **1.58.0**,
`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.32.1. Pin exact versions.

### (a) HTTP with `@x402/fetch` + `@x402/evm`

```ts
import { x402Client, wrapFetchWithPayment, x402HTTPClient } from "@x402/fetch";
import { ExactEvmScheme } from "@x402/evm/exact/client";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";

const account = privateKeyToAccount(process.env.BUYER_PRIVATE_KEY as `0x${string}`); // holds USDC on Base
const client = new x402Client();
client.setSpendControls({ maxAmountPerPayment: "$0.01" }); // exactly the approved price; a higher 402 is rejected
client.register("eip155:8453", new ExactEvmScheme(account)); // Base mainnet only
const fetchWithPayment = wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, client);
const httpClient = new x402HTTPClient(client);

const res = await fetchWithPayment("https://x402.magneta.finance/v1/risk/8453/0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913");
if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${res.status}: ${await res.text()}`);
const settle = httpClient.getPaymentSettleResponse((n) => res.headers.get(n)); // PAYMENT-RESPONSE header
const report = await res.json();
console.error("paid tx", settle.transaction, "payer", settle.payer);
```

The same wrapper is packaged as `@magnetafinance/contract-risk` (published on npm: `npm i --ignore-scripts @magnetafinance/contract-risk@0.1.2 @x402/core@2.28.0 @x402/evm@2.28.0 @x402/fetch@2.28.0 viem@2.57.7`) (`createContractRiskClient({ privateKey })` with `risk()`, `quickFlags()`, LangChain and AI SDK adapters).

### (b) MCP with `@x402/mcp`

```ts
import { createx402MCPClient } from "@x402/mcp";
import { ExactEvmScheme } from "@x402/evm/exact/client";
import { StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp.js";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";

const account = privateKeyToAccount(process.env.BUYER_PRIVATE_KEY as `0x${string}`);
const USDC_BASE = "0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913";
const APPROVED_ATOMIC = 10_000n; // exactly $0.01 in USDC base units (6 decimals), the price the user approved
const mcp = createx402MCPClient({
  name: "my-agent", version: "0.1.0",
  schemes: [{ network: "eip155:8453", client: new ExactEvmScheme(account) }], // X402_NETWORK=eip155:8453
  autoPayment: true,
  // Approve only a USDC-on-Base option at or below the approved price; anything else is refused.
  onPaymentRequested: async ({ paymentRequired }) => {
    const base = paymentRequired.accepts.filter((a) => a.network === "eip155:8453" && a.asset.toLowerCase() === USDC_BASE);
    return base.length > 0 && base.every((a) => BigInt(a.amount) <= APPROVED_ATOMIC);
  },
});
await mcp.connect(new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(new URL("https://x402.magneta.finance/mcp")));
try {
  const r = await mcp.callTool("contract_risk_summary", { chainId: 8453, address: "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913" });
  if (r.isError) throw new Error((r.content[0] as { text?: string }).text);
  const report = JSON.parse((r.content[0] as { text?: string }).text ?? "{}");
  console.error("paid:", r.paymentMade, r.paymentResponse?.transaction);
} finally { await mcp.close(); }
```

Free tools use the same client (`mcp.callTool("contract_quick_flags", {chainId, address})`, `"supported_chains"`, `"scoring_rubric"`); no payment is requested.

### (c) Coinbase CDP-managed wallet / Agentic Wallet

Documented import only (from `@coinbase/cdp-sdk` 1.58.0); it drops into `wrapFetchWithPayment` in place of the `x402Client` in (a):

```ts
import { CdpX402Client } from "@coinbase/cdp-sdk/x402";
```

It needs `CDP_API_KEY_ID`, `CDP_API_KEY_SECRET`, `CDP_WALLET_SECRET`, plus `@x402/core`, `@x402/evm`, `@x402/svm`, `@x402/extensions`
installed. Constructor options (for example which network it targets: omitting them may mean mainnet) and wallet funding are
in the CDP buyer quickstart: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/buyer/quickstart . Read it before writing the call; do not guess the API.
The wallet must hold USDC on Base mainnet to pay this service. For a no-code agent wallet, see Coinbase's Agentic Wallet docs.

## Reading the report

Key fields: `score` (0-100, higher = riskier), `level`, `flags[]`, `proxy`, `erc20` (owner, `ownerRenounced`, `paused`), `opcodes`,
`selectors.found`, `blockscout`/`sourcify` (verification), `aderyn` (`ran`, `counts`, `top`), `notes[]`.

Bands: 0-24 `low`, 25-49 `medium`, 50-74 `high`, 75-100 `critical`. Points are additive, capped at 100:

| Flag | Pts | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `unverified-source` | 25 | logic contract not verified on Blockscout nor Sourcify |
| `source-verification-unknown` | 0 | providers unreachable; not penalised, treat as unknown |
| `upgradeable-proxy` | 15 | proxy detected; admin can change behaviour |
| `owner-not-renounced` | 10 | `owner()` exists and is not the zero address |
| `mint-function` | 15 | mint selector present (supply can grow) |
| `blacklist-function` | 15 | blacklist / bot-list selector (transfers can be blocked per address) |
| `fee-or-limit-setters` | 10 | fee, tax, max-tx, max-wallet or trading-switch setters |
| `pausable` / `currently-paused` | 5 / 5 | pause selectors / `paused()` is true now |
| `selfdestruct-opcode` | 10 | SELFDESTRUCT in bytecode |
| `aderyn-high-findings:N` | 5 each, max 20 | high-severity static-analysis findings on verified source |

Caveats (from the service's own rubric, also served by `scoring_rubric`):
- Selector presence is a heuristic: the function may exist but be restricted or unused.
- A high score flags centralisation and upgrade power, not a proven exploit; a low score is not an endorsement.
- Reports are cached 10 minutes per chain+address.
- A good score on a contract whose `proxy.implementation` can be swapped is only as good as the proxy admin; check `proxy.admin`.

## Spend control

- Cap every payment at exactly `$0.01`, the price of one report and the amount the user approved: `setSpendControls({ maxAmountPerPayment: "$0.01" })` over HTTP, the `onPaymentRequested` check above over MCP. If the service ever asks for more, the payment is refused and the user is asked again.
- Use a dedicated buyer wallet with a small USDC balance; never reuse a treasury key. Never print or log the key.
- The service's `payTo` address cannot be the payer (the facilitator rejects `self_send_not_allowed`).
- Budget per task: free preview first, at most one paid report per contract per decision.

## Errors (never charged)

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 400 | unsupported chain (`supportedChains` listed in body) or malformed address; returned before any payment is requested |
| 422 | `not_a_contract`: no code at that address on that chain |
| 429 | rate limited; back off and retry |
| 502 | upstream data source failed (`analysis_failed`) |
| 504 | analysis timeout (24 s hard deadline) |

x402 settles only successful responses, so every non-2xx above costs nothing. MCP failures come back as `isError: true` and are not settled either.
A `402` that survives the client wrapper usually means: wallet has no USDC on Base, the cap is below $0.01, or the scheme network is not `eip155:8453`.
